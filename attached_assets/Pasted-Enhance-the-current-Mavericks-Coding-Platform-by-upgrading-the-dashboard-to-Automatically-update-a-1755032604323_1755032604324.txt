Enhance the current Mavericks Coding Platform by upgrading the dashboard to:

Automatically update and display user resumes and extracted skills in real time.

Dynamically align assessments and learning paths based on resume content and assessment performance.

Feature Details
1. Resume Upload & Skill Extraction
Allow users to upload or update their resume directly from the dashboard.

Use AI/NLP to:

Parse the resume.

Identify and list skills (e.g., Python, Data Science, WebApp, Figma).

Display extracted skills on the dashboard in a “Skill Summary” section.

Store extracted skills in the user profile for further processing.

2. Skill-Based Assessment Alignment
Match assessments to the skills extracted from the resume.

Example: If a user lists Python, Data Science, Figma, create relevant tests:

Python programming challenges.

Data analysis projects.

UI/UX design exercises in Figma.

Ensure the assessment difficulty adapts based on user performance.

3. Personalized Learning Path
Before assessment:

Analyze the resume to detect strengths and build a preliminary learning plan focusing on advanced topics in strong areas.

After assessment:

Identify weak areas from test results.

Generate a personalized course path:

Mix skill-refreshers in weak topics.

Include advanced learning modules for strong topics.

Present this in the dashboard under “My Learning Path”.

API Requirements
We’ll likely need three API integrations for this:

Resume Parsing & NLP Skill Extraction

To extract skills, experience, and keywords from uploaded resumes.

Suggested:

OpenAI API (via OpenRouter) – GPT model for parsing & skill mapping.

Or Rchilli / Sovren (Resume parsing APIs).

Skill → Assessment Mapping API

A logic layer (can be internal) that connects skills to existing assessment templates.

Could also use AI to dynamically create new challenges based on skill keywords.

Personalized Learning Recommendation API

AI-powered recommendation system that:

Takes skill strengths (resume).

Takes weaknesses (assessment results).

Outputs a learning path.

Suggested:

OpenAI GPT-4/5 (via OpenRouter) for reasoning + course structuring.

Optional: Integration with Coursera/EdX API for fetching real course links.

UI Alignment
No major UI changes — only:

Add a “Resume & Skills” section in the existing dashboard.

Add a “My Learning Path” panel under the same dashboard layout.

Show extracted skills visually (tags or list) without changing design style.

All new backend logic will integrate seamlessly with existing UI components.

If you give me the three API keys (OpenRouter GPT, resume parser API, and maybe an education/course API),
I can prepare the backend enhancement plan so it:

Parses resumes.

Extracts skills.

Aligns assessments.

Builds a personalized learning plan.
